<h2>POEMS OF LIFE</h2>

<h3><a id="life1">LIFE</a></h3>
<p>I feel the great immensity of life.
<br>All little aims slip from me, and I reach
<br>My yearning soul toward the Infinite.
<p>As when a mighty forest, whose green leaves
<br>Have shut it in, and made it seem a bower
<br>For lovers' secrets, or for children's sports,
<br>Casts all its clustering foliage to the winds,
<br>And lets the eye behold it, limitless,
<br>And full of winding mysteries of ways:
<br>So now with life that reaches out before,
<br>And borders on the unexplained Beyond.
<p>I see the stars above me, world on world:
<br>I hear the awful language of all Space;
<br>I feel the distant surging of great seas,
<br>That hide the secrets of the Universe
<br>In their eternal bosoms; and I know
<br>That I am but an atom of the Whole.

<h3><a id="songlife">A SONG OF LIFE</a></h3>
<p>In the rapture of life and of living,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lift up my heart and rejoice,
<br>And I thank the great Giver for giving
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of my gladness a voice.
<br>In the glow of the glorious weather,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sweet-scented, sensuous air,
<br>My burdens seem light as a feather--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are nothing to bear.
<p>In the strength and the glory of power,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pride and the pleasure of wealth
<br>(For who dares dispute me my dower
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of talents and youth-time and health?),
<br>I can laugh at the world and its sages--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am greater than seers who are sad,
<br>For he is most wise in all ages
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows how to be glad.
<p>I lift up my eyes to Apollo,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of the beautiful days,
<br>And my spirit soars off like a swallow,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is lost in the light of its rays.
<br>Are you troubled and sad?  I beseech you
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come out of the shadows of strife--
<br>Come out in the sun while I teach you
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of life.
<p>Come out of the world--come above it--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up over its crosses and graves,
<br>Though the green earth is fair and I love it,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must love it as masters, not slaves.
<br>Come up where the dust never rises--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only the perfume of flowers--
<br>And your life shall be glad with surprises
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of beautiful hours.
<br>Come up where the rare golden wine is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apollo distills in my sight,
<br>And your life shall be happy as mine is,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as full of delight.

<h3><a id="conversion">CONVERSION</a></h3>
<p>When this world's pleasures for my soul sufficed,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere my heart's plummet sounded depths of pain,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I called on Reason to control my brain,
<br>And scoffed at that old story of the Christ.
<p>But when o'er burning wastes my feet had trod,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And all my life was desolate with loss,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;With bleeding hands I clung about the cross,
<br>And cried aloud, &quot;Man needs a suffering God!&quot;

<h3><a id="lifeI">LIFE AND I</a></h3>
<p>Life and I are lovers, straying
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arm in arm along:
<br>Often like two children Maying,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of mirth and song,
<p>Life plucks all the blooming hours
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing by the way;
<br>Binds them on my brow like flowers,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls me Queen of May.
<p>Then again, in rainy weather,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sit vis-a-vis,
<br>Planning work we'll do together
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years to be.
<p>Sometimes Life denies me blisses,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I frown or pout;
<br>But we make it up with kisses
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the day is out.
<p>Woman-like, I sometimes grieve him,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try his trust and faith,
<br>Saying I shall one day leave him
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his rival, Death.
<p>Then he always grows more zealous,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tender, and more true;
<br>Loves the more for being jealous,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As all lovers do.
<p>Though I swear by stars above him,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by worlds beyond,
<br>That I love him--love him--love him;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though my heart is fond;
<p>Though he gives me, doth my lover,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kisses with each breath--
<br>I shall one day throw him over,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plight troth with Death.

<h3><a id="limitless">LIMITLESS</a></h3>
<p>There is nothing, I hold, in the way of work
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;That a human being may not achieve
<br>If he does not falter, or shrink or shirk,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And more than all, if he will _believe_.
<p>Believe in himself and the power behind
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;That stands like an aid on a dual ground,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;With hope for the spirit and oil for the wound,
<br>Ready to strengthen the arm or mind.
<p>When the motive is right and the will is strong
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no limits to human power;
<br>For that great force back of us moves along
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And takes us with it, in trial's hour.
<p>And whatever the height you yearn to climb,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho' it never was trod by the foot of man,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And no matter how steep--I say you _can_,
<br>If you will be patient-and use your time.

<h3><a id="sunsets">TWO SUNSETS</a></h3>
<p>In the fair morning of his life,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his pure heart lay in his breast,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panting, with all that wild unrest
<br>To plunge into the great world's strife
<p>That fills young hearts with mad desire,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a sunset.  Red and gold
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning billows surged and rolled,
<br>And upward tossed their caps of fire.
<p>He looked.  And as he looked, the sight
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent from his soul through breast and brain
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such intense joy, it hurt like pain.
<br>His heart seemed bursting with delight.
<p>So near the Unknown seemed, so close
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He might have grasped it with his hands
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt his inmost soul expand,
<br>As sunlight will expand a rose.
<p>One day he heard a singing strain--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A human voice, in bird-like trills.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused, and little rapture-rills
<br>Went trickling downward through each vein.
<p>And in his heart the whole day long,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in a temple veiled and dim,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept and bore about with him
<br>The beauty of that singer's song.
<p>And then?  But why relate what then?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His smouldering heart flamed into fire--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had his one supreme desire,
<br>And plunged into the world of men.
<p>For years queen Folly held her sway.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With pleasures of the grosser kind
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fed his flesh and drugged his mind,
<br>Till, shamed, he sated, turned away.
<p>He sought his boyhood's home.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That hour Triumphant should have been, in sooth,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he went forth, an unknown youth,
<br>And came back crowned with wealth and power.
<p>The clouds made day a gorgeous bed;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the splendour of the sky
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With unmoved heart and stolid eye;
<br>He only knew the West was red.
<p>Then suddenly a fresh young voice
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose, bird-like, from some hidden place,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not even turn his face--
<br>It struck him simply as a noise.
<p>He trod the old paths up and down.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their rich-hued leaves by Fall winds whirled--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How dull they were--how dull the world--
<br>Dull even in the pulsing town.
<p>O! worst of punishments, that brings
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blunting of all finer sense,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loss of feelings keen, intense,
<br>And dulls us to the higher things.
<p>O! penalty most dire, most sure,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift following after gross delights,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we no more see beauteous sights,
<br>Or hear as hear the good and pure.
<p>O! shape more hideous and more dread
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Vengeance takes in creed-taught minds,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This certain doom that blunts and blinds,
<br>And strikes the holiest feelings dead.

<h3><a id="unrest">UNREST</a></h3>
<p>In the youth of the year, when the birds were building,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the green was showing on tree and hedge,
<br>And the tenderest light of all lights was gilding
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world from zenith to outermost edge,
<br>My soul grew sad and longingly lonely!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sighed for the season of sun and rose,
<br>And I said, &quot;In the Summer and that time only
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies sweet contentment and blest repose.&quot;
<p>With bee and bird for her maids of honour
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came Princess Summer in robes of green.
<br>And the King of day smiled down upon her
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wooed her, and won her, and made her queen.
<br>Fruit of their union and true love's pledges,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful roses bloomed day by day,
<br>And rambled in gardens and hid in hedges
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like royal children in sportive play.
<p>My restless soul for a little season
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revelled in rapture of glow and bloom,
<br>And then, like a subject who harbours treason,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew full of rebellion and grey with gloom.
<br>And I said, &quot;I am sick of the summer's blisses,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of warmth and beauty, and nothing more.
<br>The full fruition my sad soul misses
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That beauteous Fall-time holds in store!&quot;
<p>But now when the colours are almost blinding,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burning and blending on bush and tree,
<br>And the rarest fruits are mine for the finding,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the year is ripe as a year can be,
<br>My soul complains in the same old fashion;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying aloud in my troubled breast
<br>Is the same old longing, the same old passion.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O where is the treasure which men call rest?

<h3><a id="artist">&quot;ARTIST'S LIFE&quot;</a></h3>
<p>Of all the waltzes the great Strauss wrote,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mad with melody, rhythm--rife
<br>From the very first to the final note.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me his &quot;Artist's Life!&quot;
<p>It stirs my blood to my finger-ends,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrills me and fills me with vague unrest,
<br>And all that is sweetest and saddest blends
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together within my breast.
<p>It brings back that night in the dim arcade,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In love's sweet morning and life's best prime,
<br>When the great brass orchestra played and played,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set our thoughts to rhyme.
<p>It brings back that Winter of mad delights,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of leaping pulses and tripping feet,
<br>And those languid moon-washed Summer nights
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we heard the band in the street.
<p>It brings back rapture and glee and glow,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It brings back passion and pain and strife,
<br>And so of all the waltzes I know,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me the &quot;Artist's Life.&quot;
<p>For it is so full of the dear old time--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So full of the dear old friends I knew.
<br>And under its rhythm, and lilt, and rhyme,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am always finding--YOU.

<h3><a id="stones">NOTHING BUT STONES</a></h3>
<p>I think I never passed so sad an hour,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear friend, as that one at the church to-night.
<br>The edifice from basement to the tower
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was one resplendent blaze of coloured light.
<br>Up through broad aisles the stylish crowd was thronging,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each richly robed like some king's bidden guest.
<br>&quot;Here will I bring my sorrow and my longing,&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, &quot;and here find rest.&quot;
<p>I heard the heavenly organ's voice of thunder,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed to give me infinite relief.
<br>I wept.  Strange eyes looked on in well-bred wonder.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dried my tears:  their gaze profaned my grief.
<br>Wrapt in the costly furs, and silks, and laces,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat alien hearts, that had no part with me.
<br>I could not read, in all those proud cold faces,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thought of sympathy.
<p>I watched them bowing and devoutly kneeling,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard their responses like sweet waters roll
<br>But only the glorious organ's sacred pealing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed gushing from a full and fervent soul.
<br>I listened to the man of holy calling,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke of creeds, and hailed his own as best;
<br>Of man's corruption and of Adam's-falling,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But naught that gave me rest:
<p>Nothing that helped me bear the daily grinding
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of soul with body, heart with heated brain;
<br>Nothing to show the purpose of this blinding
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometimes overwhelming sense of pain.
<br>And then, dear friend, I thought of thee, so lowly,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So unassuming, and so gently kind,
<br>And lo! a peace, a calm serene and holy,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settled upon my mind.
<p>Ah, friend, my friend! one true heart, fond and tender,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That understands our troubles and our needs,
<br>Brings us more near to God than all the splendour
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pomp of seeming worship and vain creeds.
<br>One glance of thy dear eyes so full of feeling,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth bring me closer to the Infinite
<br>Than all that throng of worldly people kneeling
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In blaze of gorgeous light.

<h3><a id="secrets">SECRETS</a></h3>
<p>Think not some knowledge rests with thee alone;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, even God's stupendous secret, Death,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We one by one, with our expiring breath,
<br>Do pale with wonder seize and make our own;
<br>The bosomed treasures of the earth are shown,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite her careful hiding; and the air
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yields its mysterious marvels in despair
<br>To swell the mighty store-house of things known.
<br>In vain the sea expostulates and raves;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cannot cover from the keen world's sight
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curious wonders of its coral caves.
<br>And so, despite thy caution or thy tears,
<br>The prying fingers of detective years
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall drag THY secret out into the light.

<h3><a id="uselessness">USELESSNESS</a></h3>
<p>Let mine not be that saddest fate of all
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To live beyond my greater self; to see
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My faculties decaying, as the tree
<br>Stands stark and helpless while its green leaves fall.
<br>Let me hear rather the imperious call,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which all men dread, in my glad morning time,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And follow death ere I have reached my prime,
<br>Or drunk the strengthening cordial of life's gall.
<br>The lightning's stroke or the fierce tempest blast
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which fells the green tree to the earth to-day
<br>Is kinder than the calm that lets it last,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unhappy witness of its own decay.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May no man ever look on me and say,
<br>&quot;She lives, but all her usefulness is past.&quot;

<h3><a id="will">WILL</a></h3>
<p>There is no chance, no destiny, no fate,
<br>Can circumvent or hinder or control
<br>The firm resolve of a determined soul.
<br>Gifts count for nothing; will alone is great;
<br>All things give way before it, soon or late.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What obstacle can stay the mighty force
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sea-seeking river in its course,
<br>Or cause the ascending orb of day to wait?
<p>Each well-born soul must win what it deserves.
<br>Let the fool prate of luck.  The fortunate
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he whose earnest purpose never swerves,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose slightest action or inaction serve.
<br>The one great aim.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, even Death stands still,
<br>And waits an hour sometimes for such a will.

<h3><a id="winter">WINTER RAIN</a></h3>
<p>Falling upon the frozen world last night
<br>I heard the slow beat of the Winter rain--
<br>Poor foolish drops, down-dripping all in vain;
<br>The ice-bound Earth but mocked their puny might,
<br>Far better had the fixedness of white
<br>And uncomplaining snows--which make no sign,
<br>But coldly smile, when pitying moonbeams shine--
<br>Concealed its sorrow from all human sight.
<br>Long, long ago, in blurred and burdened years,
<br>I learned the uselessness of uttered woe.
<br>Though sinewy Fate deals her most skilful blow,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not waste the gall now of my tears,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But feed my pride upon its bitter, while
<br>I look straight in the world's bold eyes, and smile.

<h3><a id="inevitable">INEVITABLE</a></h3>
<p>To-day I was so weary and I lay
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that delicious state of semi-waking,
<br>When baby, sitting with his nurse at play,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried loud for &quot;mamma,&quot; all his toys forsaking.
<p>I was so weary and I needed rest,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And signed to nurse to bear him from the room.
<br>Then, sudden, rose and caught him to my breast,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kissed the grieving mouth and cheeks of bloom.
<p>For swift as lightning came the thought to me,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With pulsing heart-throes and a mist of tears,
<br>Of days inevitable, that are to be,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my fair darling grows to manhood's years;
<p>Days when he will not call for &quot;mamma,&quot; when
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world, with many a pleasure and bright joy,
<br>Shall tempt him forth into the haunts of men
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I shall lose the first place with my boy;
<p>When other homes and loves shall give delight,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When younger smiles and voices will seem best.
<br>And so I held him to my heart to-night,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgetting all my need of peace and rest.

<h3><a id="ocean">THE OCEAN OF SONG</a></h3>
<p>In a land beyond sight or conceiving,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a land where no blight is, no wrong,
<br>No darkness, no graves, and no grieving,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There lies the great ocean of song.
<br>And its waves, oh, its waves unbeholden
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By any save gods, and their kind,
<br>Are not blue, are not green, but are golden,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like moonlight and sunlight combined.
<p>It was whispered to me that their waters
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were made from the gathered-up tears
<br>That were wept by the sons and the daughters
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of long-vanished eras and spheres.
<br>Like white sands of heaven the spray is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That falls all the happy day long,
<br>And whoever it touches straightway is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made glad with the spirit of song.
<p>Up, up to the clouds where their hoary
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowned heads melt away in the skies,
<br>The beautiful mountains of glory
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each side of the song-ocean rise.
<br>Here day is one splendour of sky-light--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of God's light with beauty replete.
<br>Here night is not night, but is twilight,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pervading, enfolding, and sweet.
<p>Bright birds from all climes and all regions,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sing the whole glad summer long,
<br>Are dumb, till they flock here in legions
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lave in the ocean of song.
<br>It is here that the four winds of heaven,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winds that do sing and rejoice,
<br>It is here they first came and were given
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of sound and a voice.
<p>Far down along beautiful beeches,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By night and by glorious day,
<br>The throng of the gifted ones reaches,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their foreheads made white with the spray,
<br>And a few of the sons and the daughters
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this kingdom, cloud-hidden from sight,
<br>Go down in the wonderful waters,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bathe in those billows of light.
<p>And their souls evermore are like fountains,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And liquid and lucent and strong,
<br>High over the tops of the mountains
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gush up the sweet billows of song.
<br>No drouth-time of waters can dry them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever has bathed in that sea,
<br>All dangers, all deaths, they defy them,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are gladder than gods are, with glee.

<h3><a id="gethsemane">GETHSEMANE</a></h3>
<p>In golden youth when seems the earth
<br>A Summer-land of singing mirth,
<br>When souls are glad and hearts are light,
<br>And not a shadow lurks in sight,
<br>We do not know it, but there lieu
<br>Somewhere veiled under evening skies
<br>A garden which we all must see--
<br>The garden of Gethsemane.
<p>With joyous steps we go our ways,
<br>Love lends a halo to our days;
<br>Light sorrows sail like clouds afar,
<br>We laugh, and say how strong we are.
<br>We hurry on; and hurrying, go
<br>Close to the borderland of woe
<br>That waits for you, and waits for me--
<br>Forever waits Gethsemane.
<p>Down shadowy lanes, across strange streams,
<br>Bridged over by our broken dreams;
<br>Behind the misty caps of years,
<br>Beyond the great salt fount of tears,
<br>The garden lies.  Strive as you may,
<br>You cannot miss it in your way;
<br>All paths that have been, or shall be,
<br>Pass somewhere through Gethsemane.
<p>All those who journey, soon or late,
<br>Must pass within the garden's gate;
<br>Must kneel alone in darkness there,
<br>And battle with some fierce despair.
<br>God pity those who cannot say,
<br>&quot;Not mine but Thine&quot;; who only pray
<br>&quot;Let this cup pass,&quot; and cannot see
<br>The PURPOSE in Gethsemane.

<h3><a id="sealed">DUST-SEALED</a></h3>
<p>I know not wherefore, but mine eyes
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See bloom, where other eyes see blight.
<br>They find a rainbow, a sunrise,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where others but discern deep night.
<p>Men call me an enthusiast,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And say I look through gilded haze:
<br>Because where'er my gaze is cast,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see something that calls for praise.
<p>I say, &quot;Behold those lovely eyes--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That tinted cheek of flower-like grace.&quot;
<br>They answer in amused surprise:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We thought it a common face.&quot;
<p>I say, &quot;Was ever seen more fair?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seem to walk in Eden's bowers.&quot;
<br>They answer, with a pitying air,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The weeds are choking out the flowers.&quot;
<p>I know not wherefore, but God lent
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deeper vision to my sight.
<br>On whatsoe'er my gaze is bent
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I catch the beauty Infinite;
<p>That underlying, hidden half
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all things hold of Deity.
<br>So let the dull crowd sneer and laugh--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their eyes are blind, they cannot see.

<h3><a id="advice">&quot;ADVICE&quot;</a></h3>
<p>I must do as you do?  Your way I own
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a very good way.  And still,
<br>There are sometimes two straight roads to a town,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One over, one under the hill.
<p>You are treading the safe and the well-worn way,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the prudent choose each time;
<br>And you think me reckless and rash to-day,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I prefer to climb.
<p>Your path is the right one, and so is mine.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not like peas in a pod,
<br>Compelled to lie in a certain line,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else be scattered abroad.
<p>'Twere a dull old world, methinks, my friend,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we all went just one way;
<br>Yet our paths will meet no doubt at the end,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they lead apart to-day.
<p>You like the shade, and I like the sun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You like an even pace,
<br> I like to mix with the crowd and run,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then rest after the race.
<p>I like danger, and storm and strife,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You like a peaceful time;
<br>I like the passion and surge of life,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You like its gentle rhyme.
<p>You like buttercups, dewy sweet,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crocuses, framed in snow;
<br>I like roses, born of the heat,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the red carnation's glow.
<p>I must live my life, not yours, my friend,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For so it was written down;
<br>We must follow our given paths to the end,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I trust we shall meet--in town.

<h3><a id="banisters">OVER THE BANISTERS</a></h3>
<p>Over the banisters bends a face,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daringly sweet and beguiling.
<br>Somebody stands in careless grace
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watching the picture, smiling.
<p>The light burns dim in the hall below,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody sees her standing,
<br>Saying good-night again, soft and low,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halfway up to the landing.
<p>Nobody only the eyes of brown,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tender and full of meaning,
<br>That smile on the fairest face in town,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the banisters leaning.
<p>Tired and sleepy, with drooping head,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder why she lingers;
<br>Now, when the good-nights all are said,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, somebody holds her fingers.
<p>He holds her fingers and draws her down,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly growing bolder,
<br>Till the loose hair drops its masses brown
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a mantle over his shoulder.
<p>Over the banisters soft hands, fair,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brush his cheeks like a feather,
<br>And bright brown tresses and dusky hair
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meet and mingle together.
<p>There's a question asked, there's a swift caress,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has flown like a bird from the hallway,
<br>But over the banisters drops a &quot;Yes,&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shall brighten the world for him alway.

<h3><a id="momus">MOMUS, GOD OF LAUGHTER</a></h3>
<p>Though with gods the world is cumbered,
<br>Gods unnamed, and gods unnumbered,
<br>Never god was known to be
<br>Who had not his devotee.
<br>So I dedicate to mine,
<br>Here in verse, my temple-shrine.
<p>'Tis not Ares,--mighty Mars,
<br>Who can give success in wars.
<br>'Tis not Morpheus, who doth keep
<br>Guard above us while we sleep,
<br>'Tis not Venus, she whose duty
<br>'Tis to give us love and beauty;
<br>Hail to these, and others, after
<br>Momus, gleesome god of laughter.
<p>Quirinus would guard my health,
<br>Plutus would insure me wealth;
<br>Mercury looks after trade,
<br>Hera smiles on youth and maid.
<br>All are kind, I own their worth,
<br>After Momus, god of mirth.
<p>Though Apollo, out of spite,
<br>Hides away his face of light,
<br>Though Minerva looks askance,
<br>Deigning me no smiling glance,
<br>Kings and queens may envy me
<br>While I claim the god of glee.
<p>Wisdom wearies, Love has wings--
<br>Wealth makes burdens, Pleasure stings,
<br>Glory proves a thorny crown--
<br>So all gifts the gods throw down
<br>Bring their pains and troubles after;
<br>All save Momus, god of laughter.
<br>He alone gives constant joy.
<br>Hail to Momus, happy boy.

<h3><a id="farewell">THE FAREWELL</a></h3>
<p>'Tis not the untried soldier new to danger
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who fears to enter into active strife.
<br>Amidst the roll of drums, the cannon's rattle,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He craves adventure, and thinks not of life.
<p>But the scarred veteran knows the price of glory,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not court the conflict or the fray.
<br>He has no longing to rehearse that gory
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And most dramatic act, of war's dark play.
<p>He who to love has always been a stranger
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;All unafraid may linger in your spell.
<br>My heart has known the warfare, and its danger.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;It craves no repetition--so farewell.

<h3><a id="past">THE PAST</a></h3>
<p>I fling my past behind me like a robe
<br>Worn threadbare in the seams, and out of date.
<br>I have outgrown it.  Wherefore should I weep
<br>And dwell upon its beauty, and its dyes
<br>Of Oriental splendour, or complain
<br>That I must needs discard it?  I can weave
<br>Upon the shuttles of the future years
<br>A fabric far more durable.  Subdued,
<br>It may be, in the blending of its hues,
<br>Where sombre shades commingle, yet the gleam
<br>Of golden warp shall shoot it through and through,
<br>While over all a fadeless lustre lies,
<br>And starred with gems made out of crystalled tears,
<br>My new robe shall be richer than the old.

<h3><a id="might">&quot;IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN&quot;</a></h3>
<p>We will be what we could be.  Do not say,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It might have been, had not or that, or this.&quot;
<br>No fate can keep us from the chosen way;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only might, who IS.
<p>We will do what we could do.  Do not dream
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chance leaves a hero, all uncrowned to grieve.
<br>I hold, all men are greatly what they seem;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does, who could achieve.
<p>We will climb where we could climb.  Tell me not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of adverse storms that kept thee from the height.
<br>What eagle ever missed the peak he sought?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always climbs who might.
<p>I do not like the phrase, &quot;It might have been!&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It lacks all force, and life's best truths perverts
<br>For I believe we have, and reach, and win,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever our deserts.

<h3><a id="sonnet">THE SONNET</a></h3>
<p>Alone it stands in Poesy's fair land,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A temple by the muses set apart;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A perfect structure of consummate art,
<br>By artists builded and by genius planned,
<br>Beyond the reach of the apprentice hand,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the ken of the untutored heart,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a fine carving in a common mart,
<br>Only the favoured few will understand.
<br>A chef d'œuvre toiled over with great care,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet which the unseeing careless crowd goes by,
<br>A plainly set, but well-cut solitaire,
<br>An ancient bit of pottery, too rare
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To please or hold aught save the special eye,
<br>These only with the sonnet can compare.

<h3><a id="nothing">NOTHING NEW</a></h3>
<p>FROM the dawn of spring till the year grows hoary,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is new that is done or said,
<br>The leaves are telling the same old story--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Budding, bursting, dying, dead.&quot;
<br>And ever and always the wild birds' chorus
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is &quot;coming, building, flying, fled.&quot;
<p>Never the round Earth roams or ranges
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of her circuit, so old, so old,
<br>And the smile o' the sun knows but these changes--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beaming, burning, tender, cold,
<br>As spring-time softens or winter estranges
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty heart of this orb of gold.
<p>From our great sire's birth to the last morn's breaking
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;There were tempest, sunshine, fruit, and frost.
<br>And the sea was calm or the sea was shaking
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;His mighty mane like a lion crossed,
<br>And ever this cry the heart was making--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Longing, loving, losing, lost.
<p>For ever the wild wind wanders, crying,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Southerly, easterly, north and west,
<br>And one worn song the fields are sighing,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sowing, growing, harvest, rest,&quot;
<br>And the tired thought of the world, replying
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Like an echo to what is last and best,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murmurs--&quot;Rest.&quot;

<h3><a id="helena">HELENA</a></h3>
<p>Last night I saw Helena.  She whose praise
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late all men have sounded.  She for whom
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Angus rashly sought a silent tomb
<br>Rather than live without her all his days.
<p>Wise men go mad who look upon her long,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is so ripe with dangers.  Yet meanwhile
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find no fascination in her smile,
<br>Although I make her theme of this poor song.
<p>&quot;Her golden tresses?&quot; yes, they may be fair,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet to me each shining silken tress
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems robbed of beauty and all lustreless--
<br>Too many hands have stroked Helena's hair.
<p>(I know a little maiden so demure
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will not let her one true lover's hands
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In playful fondness touch her soft brown bands
<br>So dainty-minded is she, and so pure.)
<p>&quot;Her great dark eyes that flash like gems at night?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large, long-lashed eyes and lustrous?&quot; that may be,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet they are not beautiful to me.
<br>Too many hearts have sunned in their delight.
<p>(I mind me of two tender blue eyes, hid
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So underneath white curtains, and so veiled
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I have sometimes plead for hours, and failed
<br>To see more than the shyly lifted lid.)
<p>&quot;Her perfect mouth so liked a carved kiss?&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Her honeyed-mouth, where hearts do, fly-like, drown?&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not taste its sweetness for a crown;
<br>Too many lips have drank its nectared bliss.
<p>(I know a mouth whose virgin dew, undried,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies like a young grape's bloom, untouched and sweet,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though I plead in passion at her feet,
<br>She would not let me brush it if I died.)
<p>In vain, Helena! though wise men may vie
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thy rare smile, or die from loss of it,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armoured by my sweet lady's trust, I sit,
<br>And know thou are not worth her faintest sigh.

<h3><a id="remains">NOTHING REMAINS</a></h3>
<p>Nothing remains of unrecorded ages
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lie in the silent cemetery time;
<br>Their wisdom may have shamed our wisest sages,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their glory may have been indeed sublime.
<br>How weak do seem our strivings after power,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How poor the grandest efforts of our brains,
<br>If out of all we are, in one short hour
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing remains.
<p>Nothing remains but the Eternal Spaces,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and decay uproot the forest trees.
<br>Even the mighty mountains leave their places,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sink their haughty heads beneath strange seas
<br>The great earth writhes in some convulsive spasms
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turns the proudest cities into plains.
<br>The level sea becomes a yawning chasm--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing remains.
<p>Nothing remains but the Eternal Forces,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sad seas cease complaining and grow dry,
<br>Rivers are drained and altered in their courses,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great stars pass out and vanish from the sky.
<br>Ideas die and old religions perish,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our rarest pleasures and our keenest pains
<br>Are swept away with all we hate or cherish--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing remains.
<p>Nothing remains but the Eternal Nameless
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all-creative spirit of the Law,
<br>Uncomprehended, comprehensive, blameless,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invincible, resistless, with no flaw;
<br>So full of love it must create for ever,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destroying that it may create again,
<br>Persistent and perfecting in endeavour,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It yet must bring forth angels, after men--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, this remains!

<h3><a id="finis">FINIS</a></h3>
<p>An idle rhyme of the summer time,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet, and solemn, and tender;
<br>Fair with the haze of the moon's pale rays,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright with the sunset's splendor.
<p>Summer and beauty over the lands--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Careless hours of pleasure;
<br>A meeting of eyes and a touching of hands--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;A change in the floating measure.
<p>A deeper hue in the skies of blue,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winds from the tropics blowing;
<br>A softer grace on the fair moon's face,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the summer going, going.
<p>The leaves drift down, the green grows brown,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And tears with smiles are blended;
<br>A twilight hour and a treasured flower,--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the poem is ended.

<h3><a id="applause">APPLAUSE</a></h3>
<p>I hold it one of the sad certain laws
<br>Which makes our failures sometime seem more kind
<br>Than that success which brings sure loss behind--
<br>True greatness dies, when sounds the world's applause
<br>Fame blights the object it would bless, because
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weighed down with men's expectancy, the mind
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can no more soar to those far heights, and find
<br>That freedom which its inspiration was.
<br>When once we listen to its noisy cheers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hear the populace' approval, then
<br>We catch no more the music of the spheres,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or walk with gods, and angels, but with men.
<br>Till, impotent from our self-conscious fears,
<br>The plaudits of the world turn into sneers.

<h3><a id="life2">LIFE</a></h3>
<p>Life, like a romping schoolboy, full of glee,
<br>Doth bear us on his shoulder for a time.
<br>There is no path too steep for him to climb.
<br>With strong, lithe limbs, as agile and as free,
<br>As some young roe, he speeds by vale and sea,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By flowery mead, by mountain peak sublime,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the world seems motion set to rhyme,
<br>Till, tired out, he cries, &quot;Now carry me!&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain we murmur; &quot;Come,&quot; Life says, &quot;Fair play!&quot;
<br>And seizes on us.  God! he goads us so!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not let us sit down all the day.
<br>At each new step we feel the burden grow,
<br>Till our bent backs seem breaking as we go,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching for Death to meet us on the way.

<h3><a id="story">THE STORY</a></h3>
<p>They met each other in the glade--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lifted up her eyes;
<br>Alack the day!  Alack the maid!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She blushed in swift surprise.
<br>Alas! alas! the woe that comes from lifting up the eyes.
<p>The pail was full, the path was steep--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached to her his hand;
<br>She felt her warm young pulses leap,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But did not understand.
<br>Alas! alas! the woe that comes from clasping hand with hand.
<p>She sat beside him in the wood--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wooed with words and sighs;
<br>Ah! love in Spring seems sweet and good,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And maidens are not wise.
<br>Alas! alas! the woe that comes from listing lovers sighs.
<p>The summer sun shone fairly down,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind blew from the south;
<br>As blue eyes gazed in eyes of brown,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His kiss fell on her mouth.
<br>Alas! alas! the woe that comes from kisses on the mouth.
<p>And now the autumn time is near,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lover roves away,
<br>With breaking heart and falling tear,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sits the livelong day.
<br>Alas! alas! for breaking hearts when lovers rove away.

<h3><a id="go">LET THEM GO</a></h3>
<p>Let the dream go.  Are there not other dreams
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vastness of clouds hid from thy sight
<br>That yet shall gild with beautiful gold gleams,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shoot the shadows through and through with light?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What matters one lost vision of the night?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the dream go!!
<p>Let the hope set.  Are there not other hopes
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That yet shall rise like new stars in thy sky?
<br>Not long a soul in sullen darkness gropes
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before some light is lent it from on high;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What folly to think happiness gone by!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the hope set!
<p>Let the joy fade.  Are there not other joys,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like frost-bound bulbs, that yet shall start and bloom?
<br>Severe must be the winter that destroys
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hardy roots locked in their silent tomb.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What cares the earth for her brief time of gloom
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the joy fade!
<p>Let the love die.  Are there not other loves
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As beautiful and full of sweet unrest,
<br>Flying through space like snowy-pinioned doves?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They yet shall come and nestle in thy breast,
<br>And thou shalt say of each, &quot;Lo, this is best!&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the love die!

<h3><a id="engine">THE ENGINE</a></h3>
<p>INTO the gloom of the deep, dark night,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With panting breath and a startled scream;
<br>Swift as a bird in sudden flight,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Darts this creature of steel and steam.
<p>Awful dangers are lurking nigh,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocks and chasms are near the track,
<br>But straight by the light of its great white eye,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;It speeds through the shadows, dense and black.
<p>Terrible thoughts and fierce desires
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Trouble its mad heart many an hour,
<br>Where burn and smoulder the hidden fires,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled ever with might and power.
<p>It hates, as a wild horse hates the rein,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrow track by vale and hill:
<br>And shrieks with a cry of startled pain;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And longs to follow its own wild will.
<p>O, what am I but an engine, shod
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;With muscle and flesh, by the hand of God,
<br>Speeding on through the dense, dark night,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Guided alone by the soul's white light.
<p>Often and often my mad heart tires,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And hates its way with a bitter hate,
<br>And longs to follow its own desires,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave the end in the hands of fate.
<p>O mighty engine of steel and steam;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;O human engine of blood and bone,
<br> Follow the white light's certain beam--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;There lies safety, and there alone.
<p>The narrow track of fearless truth,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lit by the soul's great eye of light,
<br>O passionate heart of restless youth,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone will carry you through the night.

<h3><a id="run">IN THE LONG RUN</a></h3>
<p>In the long run fame finds the deserving man.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lucky wight may prosper for a day,
<br>But in good time true merit leads the van
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vain pretence, unnoticed, goes its way.
<br>There is no Chance, no Destiny, no Fate,
<br>But Fortune smiles on those who work and wait,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run.
<p>In the long run all godly sorrow pays,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no better thing than righteous pain,
<br>The sleepless nights, the awful thorn-crowned days,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring sure reward to tortured soul and brain.
<br>Unmeaning joys enervate in the end,
<br>But sorrow yields a glorious dividend
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run.
<p>In the long run all hidden things are known,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye of truth will penetrate the night,
<br>And good or ill, thy secret shall be known,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However well 'tis guarded from the light.
<br>All the unspoken motives of the breast
<br>Are fathomed by the years and stand confess'd
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run.
<p>In the long run all love is paid by love,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though undervalued by the hosts of earth;
<br>The great eternal Government above
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeps strict account and will redeem its worth.
<br>Give thy love freely; do not count the cost;
<br>So beautiful a thing was never lost
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run.

<h3><a id="song">A SONG</a></h3>
<p>IS anyone sad in the world, I wonder?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Does anyone weep on a day like this
<br>With the sun above, and the green earth under?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, what is life but a dream of bliss?
<p>With the sun, and the skies, and the bird, above me,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Birds that sing as they wheel and fly--
<br>With the winds to follow and say they love me--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who could be lonely? O no, not I!
<p>Somebody said, in the street this morning,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;As I opened my window to let in the light,
<br>That the darkest day of the world was dawning;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;But I looked, and the East was a gorgeous sight.
<p>One who claims that he knows about it
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tells me the Earth is a vale of sin;
<br>But I and the bees and the birds--we doubt it,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And think it a world worth living in.
<p>Some one says that hearts are fickle,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;That love is sorrow, that life is care,
<br>And the reaper Death, with his shining sickle,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathers whatever is bright and fair.
<p>I told the thrush, and we laughed together,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed till the woods were all a-ring;
<br>And he said to me, as he plumed each feather,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, people must croak, if they cannot sing.&quot;
<p>Up he flew, but his song, remaining,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang like a bell in my heart all day,
<br>And silenced the voices of weak complaining,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;That pipe like insects along the way.
<p>O world of light, and O world of beauty!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are there pleasures so sweet as thine?
<br>Yes, life is love, and love is duty;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And what heart sorrows?  O no, not mine!

<h3><a id="glasses">THE TWO GLASSES</a></h3>
<p>There sat two glasses, filled to the brim,
<br>On a rich man's table, rim to rim.
<br>One was ruddy, and red as blood,
<br>And one was as clear as the crystal flood.
<p>Said the glass of wine to his paler brother,
<br>&quot;Let us tell tales of the past to each other;
<br>I can tell of banquet, and revel, and mirth,
<br>Where I was king, for I ruled in might.
<br>And the proudest and grandest souls on earth
<br>Fell under my touch, as though struck with blight.
<br>From the heads of kings, I have torn the crown,
<br>From the heights of fame, I have hurled men down;
<br>I have blasted many an honored name,
<br>I have taken virtue, and given shame;
<br>I have tempted the youth, with a sip, a taste,
<br>That has made his future a barren waste.
<br>Far greater than any king am I,
<br>Or than any army beneath the sky.
<br>I have made the arm of the driver fail,
<br>And sent the train from its iron rail.
<br>I have made good ships go down at sea,
<br>And the shrieks of the lost were sweet to me;
<br>For they said, 'Behold, how great you be!
<br>Fame, strength, wealth, genius, before you fall,
<br>And your might and power are over all.'&quot;
<br>&quot;Ho! ho! pale brother,&quot; laughed the wine,
<br>&quot;Can you boast of deeds as great as mine?&quot;
<p>Said the water glass, &quot;I cannot boast
<br>Of a king dethroned or a murdered host;
<br>But I can tell of hearts that were sad,
<br>By my crystal drops made light and glad.
<br>Of thirsts I have quenched, and brows I've laved;
<br>Of hands I have cooled, and souls I've saved.
<br>I have leaped through the valley, dashed down the mountain;
<br>Slept in the sunshine, and dripped from the fountain.
<br>I have burst my cloud fetters, and dropped from the sky,
<br>And everywhere gladdened the landscape and eye.
<br>I have eased the hot forehead of fever and pain,
<br>I have made the parched meadows grow fertile with grain;
<br>I can tell of the powerful wheel o' the mill,
<br>That ground out the flour, and turned at my will;
<br>I can tell of manhood, debased by you,
<br>That I have uplifted, and crowned anew.
<br>I cheer, I help, I strengthen and aid,
<br>I gladden the heart of man and maid;
<br>I set the chained wine-captive free,
<br>And all are better for knowing me.&quot;
<p>These are the tales they told each other,
<br>The glass of wine, and its paler brother,
<br>As they sat together, filled to the brim,
<br>On the rich man's table, rim to rim.

<h3><a id="need">WHAT WE NEED</a></h3>
<p>What does our country need?  No armies standing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sabres gleaming ready for the fight;
<br>Not increased navies, skilful and commanding,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bound the waters with an iron might;
<br>Not haughty men with glutted purses trying
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To purchase souls, and keep the power of place;
<br>Not jewelled dolls with one another vying
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For palms of beauty, elegance, and grace.
<p>But we want women, strong of soul, yet lowly,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that rare meekness, born of gentleness;
<br>Women whose lives are pure and clean and holy,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women whom all little children bless;
<br>Brave, earnest women, helpful to each other,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With finest scorn for all things low and mean;
<br>Women who hold the names of wife and mother
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far nobler than the title of a queen.
<p>Oh! these are they who mould the men of story,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These mothers, ofttimes shorn of grace and youth,
<br>Who, worn and weary, ask no greater glory
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than making some young soul the home of truth;
<br>Who sow in hearts all fallow for the sowing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seeds of virtue and of scorn for sin,
<br>And, patient, watch the beauteous harvest growing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weed out tares which crafty hands cast in;
<p>Women who do not hold the gift of beauty
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some rare treasure to be bought and sold.
<br>But guard it as a precious aid to duty--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer framing of the inner gold;
<br>Women who, low above their cradles bending,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let flattery's voice go by, and give no heed,
<br>While their pure prayers like incense are ascending
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THESE are our country's pride, our country's need,

<h3><a id="done">IS IT DONE?</a></h3>
<p>It is done! in the fire's fitful flashes,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last line has withered and curled.
<br>In a tiny white heap of dead ashes
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie buried the hopes of your world.
<br>There were mad foolish vows in each letter,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well they have shrivelled and burned,
<br>And the ring! oh, the ring was a fetter,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was better removed and returned.
<p>But ah, is it done?  In the embers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where letters and tokens were cast,
<br>Have you burned up the heart that remembers,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And treasures its beautiful past?
<br>Do you think in this swift reckless fashion
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ruthlessly burn and destroy
<br>The months that were freighted with passion,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreams that were drunken with joy?
<p>Can you burn up the rapture of kisses
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That flashed from the lips to the soul,
<br>Or the heart that grows sick for lost blisses
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of its strength of control?
<br>Have you burned up the touch of warm fingers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thrilled through each pulse and each vein,
<br>Or the sound of a voice that still lingers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hurts with a haunting refrain?
<p>Is it done? is the life drama ended?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have put all the lights out, and yet,
<br>Though the curtain, rung down, has descended,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the actors go home and forget?
<br>Ah, no! they will turn in their sleeping
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a strange restless pain in their hearts,
<br>And in darkness, and anguish, and weeping,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will dream they are playing their parts.

<h3><a id="burdened">BURDENED</a></h3>
<p>&quot;Genius, a man's weapon, a woman's burden.&quot;--Lamartine.
<p>Dear God! there is no sadder fate in life
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than to be burdened so that you can not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit down contented with the common lot
<br>Of happy mother and devoted wife.
<p>To feel your brain wild and your bosom rife
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the sea's commotion; to be fraught
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fires and frenzies which you have not sought,
<br>And weighed down with the wild world's weary strife;
<p>To feel a fever always in your breast;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lean and hear, half in affright, half shame,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud-voiced public boldly mouth your name;
<br>To reap your hard-sown harvest in unrest,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And know, however great your meed of fame,
<br>You are but a weak woman at the best.

<h3><a id="marry">TO MARRY OR NOT TO MARRY?</a></h3>
<br>A GIRL'S REVERIE
<p>Mother says, &quot;Be in no hurry,
<br>Marriage oft means care and worry.&quot;
<p>Auntie says, with manner grave,
<br>&quot;Wife is synonym for slave.&quot;
<p>Father asks, in tones commanding,
<br>&quot;How does Bradstreet rate his standing?&quot;
<p>Sister crooning to her twins,
<br>Sighs, &quot;With marriage care begins.&quot;
<p>Grandma, near life's closing days,
<br>Murmurs, &quot;Sweet are girlhood's ways.&quot;
<p>Maud, twice widowed (&quot;sod and grass&quot;)
<br>Looks at me and moans &quot;Alas!&quot;
<p>They are six, and I am one,
<br>Life for me has just begun.
<p>They are older, calmer, wiser:
<br>Age should aye be youth's adviser.
<p>They must know--and yet, dear me,
<br>When in Harry's eyes I see
<p>All the world of love there burning--
<br>On my six advisers turning,
<p>I make answer, &quot;Oh, but Harry
<br>Is not like most men who marry.
<p>&quot;Fate has offered me a prize,
<br>Life with love means Paradise.
<p>&quot;Life without it is not worth
<br>All the foolish joys of earth.&quot;
<p>So, in spite of all they say,
<br>I shall name the wedding day.

<h3><a id="march">A MARCH SNOW</a></h3>
<p>Let the old snow be covered with the new:
<br>The trampled snow, so soiled, and stained, and sodden.
<br>Let it be hidden wholly from our view
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By pure white flakes, all trackless and untrodden.
<br>When Winter dies, low at the sweet Spring's feet,
<br>Let him be mantled in a clean, white sheet.
<br>Let the old life be covered by the new:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old past life so full of sad mistakes,
<br>Let it be wholly hidden from the view
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By deeds as white and silent as snow-flakes.
<br>Ere this earth life melts in the eternal Spring
<br>Let the white mantle of repentance fling
<br>Soft drapery about it, fold on fold,
<br>Even as the new snow covers up the old.

<h3><a id="comrades">COMRADES</a></h3>
<p>I and my Soul are alone to-day,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in the shining weather;
<br>We were sick of the world, and put it away,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we could rejoice together.
<p>Our host, the Sun, in the blue, blue sky
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is mixing a rare, sweet wine,
<br>In the burnished gold of this cup on high,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, and this Soul of mine.
<p>We find it a safe and royal drink,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a cure for every pain;
<br>It helps us to love, and helps us to think,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And strengthens body and brain.
<p>And sitting here, with my Soul alone,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the yellow sun-rays fall,
<br>Of all the friends I have ever known
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it the BEST of all.
<p>We rarely meet when the world is near,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the World hath a pleasing art
<br>And brings me so much that is bright and dear
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That my Soul it keepeth apart.
<p>But when I grow weary of mirth and glee,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of glitter, glow, and splendour,
<br>Like a tried old friend it comes to me,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a smile that is sad and tender.
<p>And we walk together as two friends may,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laugh and drink God's wine.
<br>Oh, a royal comrade any day
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find this Soul of mine.

<h3><a id="crowd">IN THE CROWD</a></h3>
<p>HOW happy they are, in all seeming,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;How gay, or how smilingly proud,
<br>How brightly their faces are beaming,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;These people who make up the crowd.
<br>How they bow, how they bend, how they flutter,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;How they look at each other and smile,
<br>How they glow, and what _bons mots_ they utter!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;But a strange thought has found me the while!
<p>It is odd, but I stand here and fancy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;These people who now play a part,
<br>All forced by some strange necromancy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak, and to act, from the heart.
<br>What a hush would come over the laughter!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;What a silence would fall on the mirth!
<br>And then what a wail would sweep after,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;As the night-wind sweeps over the earth,
<p>If, the secrets held under and hidden,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the intricate hearts of the crowd,
<br>Were suddenly called to, and bidden
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;To rise up and cry out aloud,
<br>How strange one would look to another!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Old friends of long standing and years--
<br>Own brothers, would not know each other,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Robed new in their sorrows and fears,
<p>From broadcloth, and velvet, and laces,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Would echo the groans of despair,
<br>And there would be blanching of faces
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And wringing of hands and of hair.
<br>That man with his record of honour,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady down there with the rose,
<br>That girl with Spring's freshness upon her,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knoweth the secrets of those?
<p>Smile on, O ye maskers, smile sweetly!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Step lightly, bow low and laugh loud!
<br>Though the world is deceived and completely,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I know ye, O sad-hearted crowd!
<br>I watch you with infinite pity:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;But play on, play ever your part,
<br>Be gleeful, be joyful, be witty!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis better than showing the heart.

<h3><a id="space">INTO SPACE</a></h3>
<p>If the sad old world should jump a cog
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime, in its dizzy spinning,
<br>And go off the track with a sudden jog,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What an end would come to the sinning,
<br>What a rest from strife and the burdens of life
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the millions of people in it,
<br>What a way out of care, and worry and wear,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in a beautiful minute.
<p>As 'round the sun with a curving sweep
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hurries and runs and races,
<br>Should it lose its balance, and go with a leap
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the vast sea-spaces,
<br>What a blest relief it would bring to the grief,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the trouble and toil about us,
<br>To be suddenly hurled from the solar world
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let it go on without us.
<p>With not a sigh or a sad good-bye
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For loved ones left behind us,
<br>We would go with a lunge and a mighty plunge
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where never a grave should find us.
<br>What a wild mad thrill our veins would fill
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the great earth, like a feather,
<br>Should float through the air to God knows where,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And carry us all together.
<p>No dark, damp tomb and no mourner's gloom,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No tolling bell in the steeple,
<br>But in one swift breath a painless death
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a million billion people.
<br>What greater bliss could we ask than this,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sweep with a bird's free motion
<br>Through leagues of space to a resting place,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a vast and vapoury ocean--
<br>To pass away from this life for aye
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With never a dear tie sundered,
<br>And a world on fire for a funeral pyre,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the stars looked on and wondered?

<h3><a id="under">SNOWED UNDER</a></h3>
<p>Of a thousand things that the Year snowed under--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The busy Old Year who has gone away--
<br>How many will rise in the Spring, I wonder,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought to life by the sun of May?
<br>Will the rose-tree branches, so wholly hidden
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That never a rose-tree seems to be,
<br>At the sweet Spring's call come forth unbidden,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bud in beauty, and bloom for me?
<p>Will the fair green Earth, whose throbbing bosom
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is hid like a maid's in her gown at night,
<br>Wake out of her sleep, and with blade and blossom
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gem her garments to please my sight?
<br>Over the knoll in the valley yonder
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loveliest buttercups bloomed and grew;
<br>When the snow has gone that drifted them under,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will they shoot up sunward, and bloom anew?
<p>When wild winds blew, and a sleet-storm pelted,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lost a jewel of priceless worth;
<br>If I walk that way when snows have melted,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the gem gleam up from the bare brown Earth?
<br>I laid a love that was dead or dying,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year to bury and hide from sight;
<br>But out of a trance will it waken, crying,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And push to my heart, like a leaf to the light?
<p>Under the snow lie things so cherished--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopes, ambitions, and dreams of men--
<br>Faces that vanished, and trusts that perished,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never to sparkle and glow again.
<br>The Old Year greedily grasped his plunder,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And covered it over and hurried away:
<br>Of the thousand things that he did, I wonder
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many will rise at the call of May?
<br>O wise Young Year, with your hands held under
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your mantle of ermine, tell me, pray!

<h3><a id="oblige">NOBLESSE OBLIGE</a></h3>
<p>I hold it the duty of one who is gifted
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And specially dowered in all men's sight,
<br>To know no rest till his life is lifted
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully up to his great gifts' height.
<p>He must mould the man into rare completeness,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For gems are set only in gold refined.
<br>He must fashion his thoughts into perfect sweetness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cast out folly and pride from his mind.
<p>For he who drinks from a god's gold fountain
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of art or music or rhythmic song
<br>Must sift from his soul the chaff of malice,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weed from his heart the roots of wrong.
<p>Great gifts should be worn, like a crown befitting,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not like gems in a beggar's hands!
<br>And the toil must be constant and unremitting
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which lifts up the king to the crown's demands.

<h3><a id="year">THE YEAR</a></h3>
<p>What can be said in New Year rhymes,
<br>That's not been said a thousand times?
<p>The new years come, the old years go,
<br>We know we dream, we dream we know.
<p>We rise up laughing with the light,
<br>We lie down weeping with the night.
<p>We hug the world until it stings,
<br>We curse it then and sigh for wings.
<p>We live, we love, we woo, we wed,
<br>We wreathe our brides, we sheet our dead.
<p>We laugh, we weep, we hope, we fear,
<br>And that's the burden of the year.

<h3><a id="eyes">THROUGH DIM EYES</a></h3>
<p>Is it the world, or my eyes, that are sadder?
<br>I see not the grace that I used to see
<br>In the meadow-brook whose song was so glad, or
<br>In the boughs of the willow tree.
<br>The brook runs slower--its song seems lower
<br>And not the song that it sang of old;
<br>And the tree I admired looks weary and tired
<br>Of the changeless story of heat and cold.
<p>When the sun goes up, and the stars go under,
<br>In that supreme hour of the breaking day,
<br>Is it my eyes, or the dawn, I wonder,
<br>That finds less of the gold, and more of the gray
<br>I see not the splendour, the tints so tender,
<br>The rose-hued glory I used to see;
<br>And I often borrow a vague half-sorrow
<br>That another morning has dawned for me.
<p>When the royal smile of that welcome comer
<br>Beams on the meadow and burns in the sky,
<br>Is it my eyes, or does the Summer
<br>Bring less of bloom than in days gone by?
<br>The beauty that thrilled me, the rapture that filled me,
<br>To an overflowing of happy tears,
<br>I pass unseeing, my sad eyes being
<br>Dimmed by the shadow of vanished years.
<p>When the heart grows weary, all things seem dreary;
<br>When the burden grows heavy, the way seems long.
<br>Thank God for sending kind death as an ending,
<br>Like a grand Amen to a minor song.

<h3><a id="culture">TRUE CULTURE</a></h3>
<p>The highest culture is to speak no ill,
<br>The best reformer is the man whose eyes
<br>Are quick to see all beauty and all worth;
<br>And by his own discreet, well-ordered life,
<br>Alone reproves the erring.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thy gaze
<br>Turns in on thine own soul, be most severe.
<br>But when it falls upon a fellow-man
<br>Let kindliness control it; and refrain
<br>From that belittling censure that springs forth
<br>From common lips like weeds from marshy soil.

<h3><a id="gain">WHAT GAIN?</a></h3>
<p>Now, while thy rounded cheek is fresh and fair,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While beauty lingers, laughing, in thine eyes,
<br>Ere thy young heart shall meet the stranger, &quot;Care,&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or thy blithe soul become the home of sighs,
<br>Were it not kindness should I give thee rest
<br>By plunging this sharp dagger in thy breast?
<br>Dying so young, with all thy wealth of youth,
<br>What part of life wouldst thou not claim, in sooth?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the woe,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetheart, that sad souls know.
<p>Now, in this sacred hour of supreme trust,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of pure delight and palpitating joy,
<br>Ere change can come, as come it surely must,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With jarring doubts and discords, to destroy
<br>Our far too perfect peace, I pray thee, Sweet,
<br>Were it not best for both of us, and meet,
<br>If I should bring swift death to seal our bliss?
<br>Dying so full of joy, what could we miss?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing but tears,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetheart, and weary years.
<p>How slight the action!  Just one well-aimed blow
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, where I feel thy warm heart's pulsing beat,
<br>And then another through my own, and so
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our perfect union would be made complete:
<br>So, past all parting, I should claim thee mine.
<br>Dead with our youth, and faith, and love divine,
<br>Should we not keep the best of life that way?
<br>What shall we gain by living day on day?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What shall we gain,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetheart, but bitter pain?

<h3><a id="prayer">THE CHRISTIAN'S NEW YEAR PRAYER</a></h3>
<p>Thou Christ of mine, Thy gracious ear low bending
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through these glad New Year days,
<br>To catch the countless prayers to heaven ascending--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For e'en hard hearts do raise
<br>Some secret wish for fame, or gold, or power,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or freedom from all care--
<br>Dear, patient Christ, who listeneth hour on hour,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear now a Christian's prayer.
<p>Let this young year that, silent, walks beside me,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be as a means of grace
<br>To lead me up, no matter what betide me,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer the Master's face.
<br>If it need be that ere I reach the Fountain
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where living waters play,
<br>My feet should bleed from sharp stones on the mountain,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then cast them in my way.
<p>If my vain soul needs blows and bitter losses
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shape it for Thy crown,
<br>Then bruise it, burn it, burden it with crosses,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sorrows bear it down.
<br>Do what Thou wilt to mould me to Thy pleasure,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I should complain,
<br>Heap full of anguish yet another measure
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until I smile at pain.
<br>Send dangers--deaths! but tell me how to dare them;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enfold me in Thy care.
<br>Send trials, tears! but give me strength to bear them--
<br>This is a Christian's prayer.

<h3><a id="dumb">AND THEY ARE DUMB</a></h3>
<p>I have been across the bridges of the years.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wet with tears
<br>Were the ties on which I trod, going back
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the track
<br>To the valley where I left, 'neath skies of Truth,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lost youth.
<p>As I went, I dropped my burdens, one and all--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them fall;
<br>All my sorrows, all my wrinkles, all my care,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My white hair,
<br>I laid down, like some lone pilgrim's heavy pack,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the track.
<p>As I neared the happy valley with light feet,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart beat
<br>To the rhythm of a song I used to know
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long ago,
<br>And my spirits gushed and bubbled like a fountain
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down a mountain.
<p>On the border of that valley I found you,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tried and true;
<br>And we wandered through the golden Summer-Land
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand in hand.
<br>And my pulses beat with rapture in the blisses
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of your kisses.
<p>And we met there, in those green and verdant places,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling faces,
<br>And sweet laughter echoed upward from the dells
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like gold bells.
<br>And the world was spilling over with the glory
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Youth's story.
<p>It was but a dreamer's journey of the brain;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again
<br>I have left the happy valley far behind;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I find
<br>Time stands waiting with his burdens in a pack
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my back.
<p>As he speeds me, like a rough, well-meaning friend,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the end,
<br>Will I find again the lost ones loved so well?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can tell!
<br>But the dead know what the life will be to come--
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they are dumb!
